## 📘 專案概述

This project aims to detect abnormal behaviors in industrial OT environments by training an LSTM model with logs collected from **Wazuh** via API. It identifies potential multi-step attack chains and triggers alerts based on similarity scores. A real-time monitoring dashboard is provided using **Dash**.。
