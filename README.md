# Realtime_LSTM_Chain_Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to detect abnormal behaviors in industrial OT environments by training an LSTM model with logs collected from **Wazuh** via API. It identifies potential multi-step attack chains and triggers alerts based on similarity scores. A real-time monitoring dashboard is provided using **Dash**.
